# DarkzyCharacters
This is a totally Custom Character Selection made by myself and Xander1998

Please credit myself and @xander1998 and do not claim this code to be yours, this is part of our framework that has been a long project, so we thought it would be a good idea to show off our work and in hope you guys would like it. This is only a very small section of this framework... This is not guarantee to work as you do need a database system already working, this should work with ESX and ES SQL databases. This isnt just an out of the box system as this is very advanced so it isnt for the "givererupers" This will need things from you FIRST.

1. PlayerID's / Data table, this means holding identifiers etc in a table already.  (I can provide more parts to the framework to have this done easily, but you will have to message me on Discord and I will think about it :D   add me on: Darkzy#0001

2. The Database SQL will need adjusting to your needs/database setup, it's a full relational database so it will need the (f) keys to be changed to suit your database(s).

3. This will need some time and you to not rage quit if it doesnt work straight away XD, I am more than happy to help you out getting starting, means I can update the documents to improve it to help everyones situations.

4. This is not going to work in everyones instances, but you are more than welcome to use the source code to suit yourself, but YOU HAVE TO CREDIT MYSELF AND XANDER1998 somewhere in your server(s)



# Installing Characters Base by Darkzy and Xander1998
    The first thing you need to to is go ahead and remove the fivem folder from your resources and server.cfg as it is replaced             with some of the Characters code.
    
    The second thing you need to do is drop the characters folder with the __resource.lua into your resources folder and add it to your server.cfg.
    
    The Third thing you need to do is import the given SQL Query into your database, it should do all you need with errors, but if there is something massively scuffed please let me know! And I will sort it my end.



# How to install the node database

This is following the same design as as Xanders first project called XRPLife, which sadly wasnt finished as he found his love for C# bless <3 

To install and make it work correctly you need some depencies: 

1. Node JS installed on your system. Link here https://nodejs.org/en/
.. and thats it XD

For a more detailed guide please follow Xanders ExternalSQL resource readme

Link below:
https://github.com/xander1998/DatabaseAPI

This guide will help you in detail set it up. NOTE: If you are feeling fancy you can convert all the queries yourself if you don't want to use our DatabaseAPI using Node, but I am not going to help you do that. Sowrrry. :D
